# Magicblocks.io PLAYGROUND 


 .. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/3-1024x576.jpg?raw=true

The editor window consists of four components:

* The header at the top, containing the deploy button, main menu, and, if user authentication is enabled, the user menu.
* The palette on the left, containing the nodes available to use.
* The main workspace in the middle, where flows are created.
* The sidebar on the right.

The main workspace is where flows are developed by dragging nodes from the palette and wiring them together.
The workspace has a row of tabs along the top; one for each flow and any subflows that have been opened.

How to create magicblocks account
=================================

- Go to magicblocks website `http://magicblocks.io/  <http://magicblocks.io>`_


- Select SIGNUP


There are four leds on backside of the Magicbit with color red, yellow, green & blue. A LED(light-emitting diode) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Blinking a LED is the hello world to the microcontroller programming world.


BUTTON
------

There are two buttons on the front of the Magicbit. The push-button is a component that connects two points in a circuit when you press it. The example turns on an LED when you press the button.



LDR
---

There is a LDR on the front of the Magicbit. LDR(Light Dependent Resistor) is a light-controlled variable resistor. The resistance of a photo-resistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity. You can measure light intensity using LDR as a analog output.


POTENTIOMETER
-------------

The potentiometer is a component with rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. A potentiometer is a simple knob that provides a variable resistance, which we can read into the Magicbit board as an analog value.


DISPLAY
-------

OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) is a flat light emitting technology. OLED display has a film of organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current.You can display varoius graphics and text on the display.

BUZZER
------

There is a buzzer on the front of the Magicbit. Buzzer is an electronic device commonly used to produce sound.



BATTERY
-------

There is a Battery connector on the front of the Magicbit.Single cell rechargeable li-ion battery (3.7V) can be plugged in to a battery connector to puwer the Magicbit. Battery can be recharged by providing USb power to the Magicbit.


MODULES
-------

There are four module connectors on the edge connector of the Magicbit, which we refer to as ports. Which can connect various accessories to Magicbit board and program to work with Magicbit. Matching accessory pin connector color marked on the Magicbit. As an example module with blue pin connector should plug in to blue port of the Magicbit.



USB

Connecting to a WiFi network
============================

- Power up module from USB or Battery.
- Connect your device as wifi access point of your computer.




.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/SS3.png?raw=true

- Navigate to http://192.168.4.1in your browser

- Select the WiFi network through which the MagicZero should connect to internet from the dropdown menu.

- Enter the password of the WiFi network selected previously.

- Click 'Submit' and you will receive a message “Access point saved. Restarting…”- If connection to WiFi is successful, navigate to the Device Manager of your magicblocks account (refresh if already opened) and you should see that the connection is showing a green 'thumbs up' icon.

- After setting up Magicbit ,you can disconnect it from your computer Network setting and connect your default access point for getting access to the Internet._

Add your Magicbit to magicblocks
=================================

Activate PLAYGROUND in Magicblocks.io.
======================================

All your Flows create in magicblocks should be create on your PLAYGROUND. Therefore activate it firstly.

Follow these steps to do it!

- Go to the Playground tab in your Magicblocks developer account


 .. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/Untitled-1-1024x576.jpg?raw=true

Activate the playground using **start playground** reference. Then the web page appears as follows. (If you entering the playground the web page appears in bellow picture, you don't want to follow above steps)

" button in the top bar.

Editing flow properties
=======================

To edit a flow’s properties, double-click on its tab in the top bar. This will open the Flow Properties dialog.

Within the dialog, the flow’s name and description can be set. The description can use Markdown syntax for formatting and will appear in the Information sidebar.

The Status property can be used to disable or enable the flow.
